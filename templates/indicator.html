                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Efficient Frontier is a concept in modern portfolio theory introduced by Harry Markowitz. It represents a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> By investing in portfolios that lie on the Efficient Frontier, investors can achieve the best possible returns for their level of risk tolerance. It's important to diversify investments to reach this optimal mix.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Sharpe Ratios</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Sharpe Ratio, developed by William F. Sharpe, measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more attractive risk-adjusted return. Investors should aim for a higher Sharpe Ratio when evaluating potential investments or comparing the performance of different portfolios.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Value at Risk (VaR)</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Value at Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure used to assess the level of financial risk within a firm or investment portfolio over a specific time frame. VaR estimates the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio with a given probability due to market risk.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> VaR helps in risk management by quantifying potential losses. Investors and financial managers can use VaR to determine the amount of capital reserves needed to cover potential losses. Regularly calculating VaR can help in maintaining a balanced risk profile.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Simple Moving Average (SMA)</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> SMA helps to smooth out price data and identify trends. It's best used in conjunction with other indicators. A rising SMA indicates an uptrend, while a falling SMA indicates a downtrend.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that gives more weight to recent prices in an attempt to make it more responsive to new information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> EMA is useful for identifying trend direction and potential reversals. It's more sensitive to price movements than SMA, which makes it better for short-term trading.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale of 0 to 100.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> RSI values above 70 indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold conditions. Traders use RSI to identify potential buy and sell signals.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">MACD</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> MACD helps to identify potential buy and sell signals. A bullish signal occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, while a bearish signal occurs when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-header">MACD Signal</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The MACD Signal line is the 9-day EMA of the MACD line and is used to identify changes in the momentum of the stock price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> The MACD Signal line helps confirm MACD crossovers. When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it suggests a buy signal, and when it crosses below, it suggests a sell signal.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Middle Band of Bollinger Bands is typically a 20-day SMA of the closing prices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> The Middle Band represents the average price over a period. It can be used to identify the trend direction and potential support or resistance levels.</p>

                <div class="collapsible-body">
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Upper Band of Bollinger Bands is calculated by adding twice the standard deviation to the middle band.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> The Upper Band represents a potential resistance level. When prices move above the upper band, it indicates overbought conditions.</p>
